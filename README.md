# [SDF04] Magic buttons 

I have decided on this project to incorporate fun and bright colors into my code so that my buttons stand out.
As you can probably tell, I am a fan of pink and green and incorporated those colors a lot.

Interesting enough, FUDGE is my clothing brand and that is the reason I changed the words in the buttons to 'Happy FUDGE Day'

By incorporating transitions, I think it adds a bit of excitement when hovering over the buttons that you are selecting.

I also incoporated letter spacing with two of the buttons that space out when you are hovering over the button,
and this is something that I felt was unique and fun to do as not many buttons have letter spacing. 

# Challenges Faced 

I did find that I had challenges when coming to being able to incoporate my borders when coding the hovering so that I can have funky styles that come together and connect around when hovering.
